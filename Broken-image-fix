Ripped from some form online
--------------------------
Boot your machine with a Live Media
Open terminal and type: 
    
    sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda5 sda5_crypt #In case you're drive is encryted 
    sudo vgscan --mknodes
    sudo vgchange -ay
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root /mnt
    sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
    for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done
    sudo chroot /mnt

--------------------------
After Chroot is done, we will be backing up the image file of initrd, you can see the image files under /boot.

    # ls /boot/*initrd*

    or

    # ls /lib/modules/

kernel-module

You will be able to get the version of the kernel you have currently in the system from the above command.

Consider replacing version 3.11.0.12-generic with the own you got from above command.

    # mv /boot/initrd.img-3.11.0.12-generic /boot/old-initrd.img-3.11.0.12-generic-old

Note: the file format of the initrd image may differ from Ubuntu to Fedora Based Systems.

If your initrd image has been deleted, you won't be able to run the above command hence, can't create its backup.
--------------------------
Building Initrd Image

Now, the real stuff is here. We are gonna build the initrd kernel image here using the command below:

    # mkinitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.11.0.12-generic 3.11.0.12-generic-old

The above command works for the other distributions like CentOS, Fedora, Red Hat,etc not for Ubuntu

For Ubuntu Based Distribution:

    # update-initramfs -c -k 3.11.0.12-generic

update-initramfs
--------------------------
Finalizing Grub Loader and unmounting

We will go for unmounting the mounted path as:

If your system has Fedora, RHEL, CentOS installed, try this:

    # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

If your system has Ubuntu and its derivative installed:

    # update-grub

    # exit

grub-update
--------------------------
Now, we have successfully left our Chroot Environment.

    $ sudo umount /dev

    $ sudo umount /proc

    $ sudo umount /sys

    $ sudo umount /mnt
--------------------------
