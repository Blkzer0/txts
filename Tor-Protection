3. Goto 'NoScript Options > Embeddings', tick everything except 'No placeholder for..' and 'Collapse blocked objects'
4. Goto 'NoScript Options > Advanced > XSS', remove all Anti-XSS Protection Exceptions

2. Install RequestPolicy Continued
This addon is even more important than NoScript, it allows Tor Browser to block all external resources by default (image, video, script, font that is not on the same domain), until you explicitly allow each external domain to be loaded.

The old RequestPolcy has not been updated for many years, RequestPolicy Continued has taken its place.
